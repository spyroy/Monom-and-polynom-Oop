# this project deals with Monom and Polynom.

## Monom: in this project Monom most be of shape +-ax\X^b where 'a' is double and 'b' Integer (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomial)

## Polynom:int this project Polynom most be of shape +-a_1x\X^b_1 +-a_2x\X^b_2... where each element is a Monom (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial)

### Monom has 7 main function:
1) constructor, recives two numbers: 'a' Double 'b' Integer and build a Monom with coefficient a and power b.
2) derivative, recives a Monom and returns the derivative. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative)
3) f function, recives real number 'x' and returns the value of the Monom at - 'x' point.
4) is zero, returns if the the Monom equals to - 0 or not.
5) String constructor, recives string from user and converts it to Monom type.
6) add, recives Monom and add it to another Monom only if the degrees are equal.
7) multiply, recives Monom and multiply it to another Monom, by multiply the coefficient and adding the degree.

### Polynom has 13 main function:
1) String constructor, recives string from user and converts it to Polynom type.
2) f function, recives real number 'x' and returns the value of the Polynom at - 'x' point.
3) add Polynom, recives Polynom and add it to another Polynom by Polynomial arithmetic. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_arithmetic)
4) add Monom, recives Monom and add it to another Polynom by Polynomial arithmetic. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_arithmetic)
5) subtract Polynom, recives Polynom and subtract it from another Polynom by Polynomial arithmetic. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_arithmetic)
6) multiply Polynom, recives Polynom and multiply it by another Polynom by Polynomial arithmetic. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_arithmetic)
7) equals, recives Polynom and checks if it equal to another Polynom, returns true if it does and false otherwise.
8) is zero, returns if the the Polynom equals to - 0 or not.
9) root, returns the value which the function represented by the given Polynom gets zero.(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_of_a_function)
10) copy, deep copy of the Polynom.
11) derivative, recives a Polynom and returns the derivative. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative)
12) area, returns the area below the function represented by the given Polynom based on rimann's integral.(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_integral)
13) multiply Monom, recives Monom and multiply it by another Polynom by Polynomial arithmetic.
